# Makefile
#
# This Makefile provides a set of useful commands for setting up and managing
# this Python project. It uses 'uv' for fast dependency management.
# All commands that need the virtual environment are run via 'uv run'.
#

# Use bash as the shell
SHELL := /bin/bash

# Define the Python interpreter
# This makes it easy to switch between python versions if needed
PYTHON := python3

# --- PHONY TARGETS ---
# .PHONY ensures that make will run the command even if a file with the same
# name as the target exists.
.PHONY: all setup start debug devcontainer format check ruff clean help

# --- DEFAULT TARGET ---
# The default target that runs when you just type 'make'
all: help

# --- SETUP AND INSTALLATION ---
# Sets up the development environment.
# It checks if 'uv' is installed. If not, it installs it.
# Then, it syncs the Python dependencies from your pyproject.toml.

		echo "--> uv not found. Installing uv..."; \

# --- DEVELOPMENT TASKS ---
# Runs the main application script within the uv-managed environment.
start:
	@echo "--> Starting the application..."

# Executes the start script within a devcontainer.

# --- LINTING AND FORMATTING ---
# Formats the code using Ruff.
format:

	@uv run ruff format .

# Checks for linting errors with Ruff and attempts to fix them.
check:
	@echo "--> Checking and fixing code with Ruff..."
	@uv run ruff check . --fix

# A convenience target to run both format and check.

# --- CLEANUP ---
# Cleans up Python bytecode and cache directories.
