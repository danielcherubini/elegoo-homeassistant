## üõ∞Ô∏è Local Proxy Server

Printers like the Elegoo Centauri Carbon have a built-in limit of 4 simultaneous connections. Since the video stream consumes one of these connections by itself, users can easily hit this limit, resulting in "connection limit reached" errors.

The optional proxy server solves this by acting as a single gateway. It routes all commands, file uploads, and **even the video stream** through just one stable connection to the printer, effectively bypassing the limit and preventing connection conflicts.

You can enable the proxy server during the initial setup of the integration or at any time afterward by clicking **"Configure"** on the integration card.

## üñ®Ô∏è Supported Printers

This integration is designed to work with Elegoo printers that use the `SDCP` protocol. The following models have been tested and are known to work:

### Resin Printers

* Mars 4
* Mars 4 Ultra
* Saturn 3
* Saturn 3 Ultra
* Saturn 4
* Saturn 4 Ultra

### FDM Printers

* Centauri Carbon

If your printer isn't listed but uses the `SDCP` protocol, it may still work. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/danielcherubini/elegoo-homeassistant/issues) to let us know!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

The recommended way to install this integration is through the [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/).

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=danielcherubini&repository=elegoo-homeassistant&category=Integration)

1.  In HACS, go to **Integrations** and click the **"+" (Explore & Download Repositories)** button.
2.  Search for **"Elegoo Printers"** and select it.
3.  Click **"Download"** and follow the prompts.
4.  After downloading, **restart Home Assistant**.

---

## üîß Configuration

Once installed, you can add your printer to Home Assistant:

1.  Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2.  Click **"Add Integration"** and search for **"Elegoo Printers"**.
3.  The integration will attempt to auto-discover printers on your network. If your printer is found, select it from the list.
4.  If no printer is discovered, you can select **"Configure manually"** and enter your printer's IP address.
5.  Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the setup. You will be able to enable the **Local Proxy Server** during this step.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Firmware v1.1.29 Bug Notice

Please be aware that the Elegoo firmware **version 1.1.29** has a bug that prevents remote control of lights, temperatures, and fans **while a print is in progress**. This is a limitation within the printer's firmware itself. Previous versions (like v1.1.25) do not have this bug.
