I've reviewed the changes and this is a significant improvement to the integration's stability and robustness, especially with the proxy server. Moving the proxy to the Home Assistant event loop is a major step forward.

Here's a summary of my review:

*   **`api.py` & `coordinator.py`:** The connection, reconnection, and error handling logic are much more robust now. The new `ElegooPrinterTimeoutError` and the improved reconnection logic in the coordinator will make the integration more resilient to network issues.
*   **`websocket/server.py`:** The refactoring to a fully asynchronous proxy server is excellent. This is a much cleaner and more efficient approach than the previous thread-based implementation.
*   **`sdcp/exceptions.py` & `websocket/client.py`:** The addition of the `ElegooPrinterTimeoutError` is a good change that allows for more specific error handling.

I have one minor suggestion:

*   **Docstrings:** The docstring for the `ElegooPrinterServer` class in `custom_components/elegoo_printer/websocket/server.py` still mentions that the server runs in a background thread. It would be great to update it to reflect the new asynchronous implementation.

Overall, this is a fantastic pull request. I'll approve it once the docstring is updated.
